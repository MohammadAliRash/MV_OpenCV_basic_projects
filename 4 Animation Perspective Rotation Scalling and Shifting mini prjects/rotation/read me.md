Image Rotation Project
This project showcases image rotation at different angles using OpenCV in Python.

Description
In this project, an image ('rabbit3.jpg') is read, and rotation transformations are applied at angles of 45, 90, 135, and 180 degrees. The script rotates the image at each angle and displays the original and rotated images using matplotlib for comparison.

Requirements
To run this project, you need the following libraries installed:

OpenCV (cv2)
NumPy
Matplotlib

Usage
Ensure you have the required libraries installed.
Place the image file 'rabbit3.jpg' in the same directory as your Python script.
Run the script to apply rotation transformations at different angles to the image.
The original and rotated images at angles 45, 90, 135, and 180 degrees will be displayed for comparison.

Code Explanation
The script reads the image, applies rotation transformations at various angles, and displays the original and rotated images for visualization.
