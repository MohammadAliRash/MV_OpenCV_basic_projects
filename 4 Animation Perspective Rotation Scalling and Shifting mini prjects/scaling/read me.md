Image Scaling Project
This project demonstrates image scaling using OpenCV in Python.

Description
In this project, an image ('pizza.jpg') is read, and the script scales the image by a factor of 0.5 in both the x and y directions. The scaled image is displayed alongside the original image using matplotlib for comparison.

Requirements
To run this project, you need the following libraries installed:

OpenCV (cv2)
NumPy
Matplotlib

Usage
Ensure you have the required libraries installed.
Place the image file 'pizza.jpg' in the same directory as your Python script.
Run the script to scale the image by a factor of 0.5 in both directions.
The original and scaled images will be displayed for visual comparison.

Code Explanation
The script reads the image, scales it by a factor of 0.5 in both the x and y directions, and displays the original and scaled images for visualization.
