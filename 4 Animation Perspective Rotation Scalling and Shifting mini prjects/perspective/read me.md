Image Perspective Transformation Project
This project demonstrates perspective transformation on an image using OpenCV in Python.

Description
In this project, an image ('sudoku.jpg') is read and transformed using perspective transformation. The script calculates the transformation matrix based on original and calculated points, applies the perspective transformation, and displays the original and transformed images using matplotlib.

Requirements
To run this project, you need the following libraries installed:
OpenCV (cv2)
Matplotlib
NumPy

Usage
Ensure you have the required libraries installed.
Place the image file 'sudoku.jpg' in the same directory as your Python script.
Run the script to apply perspective transformation to the image.
The original and transformed images will be displayed to visualize the perspective transformation.

Code Explanation
The script reads the image, defines original and calculated points, calculates the perspective transformation matrix, applies the transformation, and displays the original and transformed images for comparison.
