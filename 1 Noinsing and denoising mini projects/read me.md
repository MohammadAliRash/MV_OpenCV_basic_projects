Image Denoising Project
This project utilizes three main libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib, and OpenCV for image processing tasks. The primary focus is on noise generation and removal using OpenCV functions. The development environment used for coding is Visual Studio Code.

Project Overview
The workflow involved importing several images into the project and applying noise to them. Some images did not clearly show the applied noise, so we converted them to grayscale to enhance noise visibility. Subsequently, we applied six different denoising algorithms to these images to partially eliminate the noise. Due to project size limitations on the university website, some images displayed in the report are not present in the project file.

Technical Result
The technical outcome of this research involves introducing and applying noise to images, extracting results in computer vision, and then removing noise using algorithms and denoising methods in the OpenCV library.

Additional Data and Noise
Additional data beyond the original image data that compromises image quality and quantity is referred to as noise. Sources of noise include imaging devices, electrical and electronic interferences, digitalization processes, etc.

Noise Types:
*Gaussian Noise: A type of random noise with a Gaussian or normal distribution. It is commonly observed in natural and engineering random processes like audio signals and images.
*Impulsive Noise: Sudden noise in an image. Methods for creating impulsive noise involve adding noise using random functions or filters.
*Uniform Noise: A type of noise where each value within a specific range has an equal probability of occurrence.

Denoising Approaches:
*Bilateral Denoising
*Fast NImeans Denoising
*Median Blur Denoising
*Smoothing Denoising
*Gaussian Blur Denoising
