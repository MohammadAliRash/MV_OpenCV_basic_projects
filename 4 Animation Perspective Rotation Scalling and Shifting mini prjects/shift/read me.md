Image Translation Project
This project showcases image translation in OpenCV using Python.

Description
In this project, an image ('pizza.jpg') is read, and the script translates the image by 50 pixels in the x-direction and 25 pixels in the y-direction. The translated image is displayed alongside the original image using matplotlib for comparison.

Requirements
To run this project, you need the following libraries installed:

OpenCV (cv2)
NumPy
Matplotlib

Usage
Ensure you have the required libraries installed.
Place the image file 'pizza.jpg' in the same directory as your Python script.
Run the script to translate the image by 50 pixels in the x-direction and 25 pixels in the y-direction.
The original and translated images will be displayed for visual comparison.

Code Explanation
The script reads the image, defines a transformation matrix for translation, performs the image translation, and displays the original and translated images for visualization.
