Analog to Digital Clock Conversion Project

Overview
This project focuses on converting analog clock images to digital clock format using computer vision techniques. The main objective is to detect the positions of the hour and minute hands in an analog clock image and then convert this information into a digital time format.

Features
Detects and highlights the hour and minute hands in an analog clock image.
Converts the detected analog time to digital time format.
Provides a visual representation of the analog clock with overlaid digital time.

Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV
NumPy

Installation
Clone the repository:
bash

Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/analog-to-digital-clock-conversion.git
Install the required packages:
bash

Copy
pip install opencv-python numpy
Usage
Navigate to the project directory:
bash

Copy
cd analog-to-digital-clock-conversion
Run the main script:
bash

Copy
python clock_conversion.py
The script will process the analog clock images in the data/ directory, detect the clock hands, and display the digital time overlaid on the images.

Customization
Adjust parameters in the clock_conversion.py script to fine-tune the clock hand detection algorithm for different clock designs.
Modify the digital time display format based on your preferences.

File Structure
clock_conversion.py: Main script for analog to digital clock conversion.
data/: Directory containing analog clock images for testing.
README.md: Detailed information about the project.
utils/: Additional utility functions for image processing.

Sample Output
The script will display the detected clock hands as bounding boxes overlaid on the analog clock images.
The converted digital time will be displayed on the images for easy interpretation.
