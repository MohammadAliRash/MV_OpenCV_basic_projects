Image Transformation Project
This project demonstrates image rotation and translation using OpenCV in Python.

Description
In this project, an image ('1.png') is read and transformed through rotation and translation. The image is first rotated by varying angles in a loop and displayed to create a rotating effect. Subsequently, the rotated image is shifted by changing offsets in another loop, creating a shifting effect. The transformed images are displayed in sequence to visualize the rotation and translation operations.

Requirements
To run this project, you need the following libraries installed:
OpenCV (cv2)
NumPy

Usage
Ensure you have the required libraries installed.
Place the image file '1.png' in the same directory as your Python script.
Run the script to apply rotation and translation transformations to the image.
The transformed images will be displayed to show the rotating and shifting effects.

Code Explanation
The script reads the image, performs rotation by varying angles to create a rotating effect, and then shifts the rotated image by changing offsets to create a shifting effect. Each transformed image is displayed to visualize the effects of rotation and translation.
