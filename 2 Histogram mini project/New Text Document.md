OpenCV Image Histogram and 3D Plot Project
This OpenCV project focuses on image histogram equalization and the creation of HLS, HSV, and RGB histograms along with a 3D plot visualization. The project utilizes the NumPy, Matplotlib, and OpenCV libraries for image processing tasks.

Project Overview:
*Image Histogram Equalization: The project includes histogram equalization of the input image to enhance its contrast and improve overall image quality.
*Histogram Creation: It generates HLS, HSV, and RGB histograms to analyze and visualize the color distribution in the images.
\*3D Plot: A 3D plot is created to provide a comprehensive visualization of the color space and histogram data.

Libraries Used:
*NumPy: Used for numerical operations and array manipulation.
*Matplotlib: Utilized for plotting graphs, including the 3D plot in this project.
\*OpenCV: Mainly used for image processing tasks, histogram equalization, and color space conversions.

Instructions:
Environment Setup: Ensure you have Python installed with NumPy, Matplotlib, and OpenCV libraries.
Project Execution: Run the project script to perform histogram equalization, generate color histograms, and visualize them in a 3D plot.

How to Run
Clone the repository or download the project files.
Install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the project_script.py file to execute the project and generate the output images and histograms.

Notes
Feel free to customize the project script to add more functionalities or enhance the visualization.
Experiment with different images to observe the effects of histogram equalization and color space analysis.
